My first app :[App Web](https://astra34.github.io/MyApp/).

Note:

-if you don't create an account or log in, the server isn't turned on.

-The server used is the one on my other repository (App node), it is hosted thanks to render.

-This web app uses React for the front end and node js with express for the back end.

-The session system is managed with tokens(jwt).

-The database used is mongodb.
